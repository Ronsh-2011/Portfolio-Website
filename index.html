    <p> I like to do coding. I am in ADV class.</p>
    <hr>
    <p> I made a story called The long Journey</p>
    <p>I  was walking down the street and suddenly, I was hit by someone and they took me somewhere. They tied a scarf on my eyes and my hands also. After sometime, they took out the scarf which was tied to my eye. I saw here and there it was a forest. One guy asked me a question, he asked, ”Give us the green chip ”. As . I am a coder. I developed a chip called a green chip in the coding lab. “Sorry” , I did not tell you before that I am a coder and my  name is Ronav. After that guy asked me the question several times. I gave him a straightforward answer “No, I will not give you”.They said “Ok you will stay here alone”. They left me alone and drove to the city. I was wondering  how to untie my hands. Thinking for a while I remember that I watched a video. In that video, the speaker was talking about how to untie your hands. So, I used a trick to untie my hands and it worked. “I was surprised”. Now, I need to get out of this forest as soon as possible. So, after walking for miles and miles I was exhausted. I walked and walked and I reached the city. I was starving. so, I ate something in a restro and went to my home but I reached somewhere else “You got to be kidding me”. Now, I need to get out of here “What a frustrating journey!” So I  took a cab and went to my city. It was so dark that  I could barely see outside the cab. The driver told me that the city, which I want to go to is very far. So, he gave me a suggestion. An idea of going to a nearby hotel. I think his suggestion was good. So, he dropped me in the hotel. I rested in the hotel and early in the morning, I booked a taxi to my city when I reached the city 
and went home. I made a coffee and ate something.Now I can  take a power nap and do coding.                                          
                                                                     To be continue...
